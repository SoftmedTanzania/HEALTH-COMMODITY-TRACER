Health Commodity tracer application is an Android Mobile application used to track stock of various medical commodities in the health facilities for FHI360's Boresha Afya Southern Project in Tanzania.

The application tracks stocks on hand of health commodities, stock out days of health commodities, and the number of patients on a specified regime.

The application also provides reminders for health care workers to report the above information timely, and the information is aggregated and shared to project managers in Boresha Afya for timely decision making and transparent visibility of stock on health facilities.
